## 1. Introduction:

Welcome to our sprint planning session. As we embark on this new phase, our primary focus is to lay the groundwork for our application's architecture and to prioritize user-centric features like account creation and login functionalities. This meeting is designed to provide clarity on our direction for the upcoming sprint, ensuring that every team member is equipped with a clear understanding of our objectives and their respective roles in achieving them. Let's collaborate, align our visions, and set the stage for a successful sprint.

## 2. Review of Previous Sprint:

## 3. Product Backlog Refinement:

In our recent meeting, we peeled back the layers of our backlog items to synchronize them with our evolving project direction and forthcoming technical integrations. Here’s a succinct recap:

- **Initial Application Structure:** We underscored the imperative of smooth integration with third-party APIs, particularly considering our strategy to harness Google's API for user management. Technical requirements were fine-tuned to ensure harmonization and peak performance with these integrations.
- **User Registration:** Given our inclination towards utilizing Google's API, the conversation pivoted from crafting our own registration system to optimally using the API for effortless account creation and management. The user journey, particularly when using Google for registration and the data retrieval from Google to simplify the user onboarding process, was methodically discussed.
- **Login Mechanism:** The team explored the user-centric approach of using Google's API to alleviate the login process. A thorough discourse about the user interface and experience when logging in with Google occurred, ensuring that we are creating an intuitive and seamless process for our users.
- **Profile Management:** The discussion about profile management did touch upon leveraging Google's API to perhaps pre-populate certain account details, aiming to minimize the manual input from users. The concept of permitting a preview before any final changes are enacted was well-received and will be considered moving forward.
- **User Activity Tracking:** We resolved to explore Spring for monitoring user activity duration within the app. This approach aims not just to understand our users better but also to unearth opportunities to enhance user interaction and engagement in future iterations.

These dialogues and resultant refinements were instrumental in streamlining our focus and priming us for the imminent development phase. Geared up and aligned, we’re prepared to embark on a sprint that promises robust development and insightful learnings!

## 4. Sprint Goal and Scope:

**Sprint Goal:** "For this sprint, our primary objective is to lay down the foundational elements of our application and establish a secure and user-friendly account management system. Let’s ensure our users can smoothly create, access, modify, and sign out of their accounts."

**Scope for This Sprint:** Here’s our roadmap for the sprint:
- **Basic Framework:** We'll kick off by setting up the core structure of our application. This is the backbone, ensuring everything we build subsequently has a solid base.
- **User Registration:** Next, we'll focus on user registration. We want to enable our users to set up their own accounts using a username, email, and a secure password. This is the gateway to personalized experiences in our app.
- **Login Mechanism:** After signing up, our users should find it seamless to log into their accounts. Let's prioritize this and ensure it's both intuitive and secure.
- **Profile Management:** Users should have the autonomy to update their personal details when required. We'll develop a feature for them to easily modify information like their name, address, and phone number.
- **Secure Logout:** Lastly, security is paramount. Once our users decide to log out, we must ensure their data remains private and their session ends securely.

That's our strategy laid out. For a detailed breakdown of tasks, including estimations and assignments, make sure to consult the Sprint Backlog. Let’s stay aligned, communicate effectively, and make this sprint a success!

## 5. Definition of Done:

For each story we tackle in this sprint, we've set a clear "Definition of Done" to ensure quality and consistency. Before we mark any story as complete, it must meet the following criteria:
- All Acceptance Criteria and Tasks Addressed: Every task associated with the story must be successfully completed, and the implementation must fulfill all outlined acceptance criteria.
- Unit Tests Conducted: Alongside the main implementation, proper unit tests must be created and run to validate the functionality. These tests should pass without any issues.
- Code Review and Integration: The code branch associated with the story should undergo a thorough review by peers. Any feedback should be addressed and incorporated. Once reviewed, the branch should be successfully merged into our main codebase without conflicts.

By adhering to this "Definition of Done", we're ensuring that our output not only meets our internal standards but also offers a seamless experience for our end-users.

## 6. Capacity Planning:

As we gear up for our upcoming sprint, running from 10/18 to 10/31, we're approaching capacity planning with a flexible mindset, acknowledging the diverse responsibilities each of us carries. Here's our approach:

- **Team Composition:** We are a close-knit team of 4 members. Although passionate about this graduate school project, we also juggle responsibilities from our full-time careers.
- **Flexible Commitment:** Instead of binding ourselves to a fixed number of hours per week, we've collectively decided to play it by ear. We trust each member to contribute to the best of their ability, considering their other commitments.
- **Communication is Key:** Our strength lies in our open communication. Throughout the sprint, we pledge to regularly check in, updating the team on our individual progress and any potential constraints we might face.
- **Team Support:** Recognizing that some weeks might be more demanding than others for individual members, we're committed to stepping in and supporting each other. If someone struggles with their user stories due to unforeseen commitments, another team member will be there to assist, ensuring that we maintain our momentum.
- **Adjusted Capacity:** Given our flexible approach, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact capacity figure for this sprint. However, we'll continuously monitor our progress, making necessary adjustments along the way to ensure our objectives are met.

Our approach prioritizes the well-being of our team members, ensuring that while we strive for project success, it doesn't come at the cost of undue stress or pressure. This collaborative and supportive method ensures that we remain productive, cohesive, and resilient throughout the sprint duration.
