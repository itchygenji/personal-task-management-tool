## Sprint Retrospective Meeting

| WHAT WENT WELL | WHAT DIDN’T GO SO WELL | INSIGHTS (up to 3) AND ACTIONS (JUST ONE) |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| All tasks and stories were completed successfully, despite initial struggles with technology. | Challenges in connecting the front end to the back end for task and profile management; time-consuming resolution of a persistent MongoDB bug. | Insight: Lack of experience with technology stack can lead to increased task completion time. <br> Action: Allocate additional time for resolving technical issues and include more hands-on practice with the tech stack. |
| The team showed resilience and dedication to resolve issues and learn from the experience. | Some team members had difficulties with specific functionalities like adding, editing, or deleting tasks due to unfamiliarity with the stack. | Insight: More experience is needed with full-stack integration. <br> Action: Conduct focused training sessions on full-stack development and troubleshooting. |
| Despite personal commitments, the team managed to meet the sprint goals. | | Insight: Effective time management and dedication can overcome external schedule pressures. <br> Action: Continue to encourage flexible scheduling and time management best practices among team members. |

This multiplier ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents that you provided minimal support to your team and 1 represents that you were a productive member of the team and did all assigned tasks.
