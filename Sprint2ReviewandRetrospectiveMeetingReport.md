## Sprint Retrospective Meeting

| WHAT WENT WELL | WHAT DIDN’T GO SO WELL | INSIGHTS AND ACTIONS |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| The completion of all stories reflects the team's growing competency and commitment to the project goals. | Initial integration issues between the front and back end presented a significant learning curve. | **Insight**: Integration challenges are common in full-stack development. **Action**: Establish a more robust process for integration testing early in the sprint. |
| Communication and collaborative problem-solving were key to overcoming the persistent database issue with MongoDB. | The time spent on troubleshooting the MongoDB bug affected our overall productivity. | **Insight**: Unfamiliarity with certain technologies can lead to unpredicted complications. **Action**: Invest in shared knowledge sessions post-sprint to review and learn from technical hurdles. |
| Adaptability to the tools and technology stack was demonstrated as the team overcame various hurdles. | Underestimation of task complexity due to inexperience led to longer than anticipated task durations. | **Insight**: Accurate task estimation is a skill that improves with experience. **Action**: Use retrospective insights to refine estimation techniques for future sprints. |
| Despite external challenges, such as illness and personal commitments, the team managed to stay on track and maintain productivity. | Balancing project work with external commitments was a persistent challenge for the team. | **Insight**: External pressures can impact sprint progress but can be mitigated with good communication and flexibility. **Action**: Enhance the existing contingency plans to better handle unexpected team member absences. |
| The team's resilience in the face of technical difficulties has set a strong foundation for future sprints. | | **Insight**: A resilient team can turn challenges into opportunities for growth and improvement. **Action**: Recognize and celebrate the resilience shown by team members as a morale booster. |

**Each team member’s contribution on the project development.** Contribution works as a scalar multiplier applied to the group’s grade for an individual deliverable. This multiplier ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents that you provided minimal support to your team and 1 represents that you were a productive member of the team and did all assigned tasks.
