## 1. Introduction:
As we commence Sprint 2, our objective is to enhance user capabilities in managing their tasks within our application. This will include the ability to log out, edit profile information, and full control over task creation, viewing, editing, and deletion.

## 2. Review of Previous Sprint:
During Sprint 1, which took place on 10/19/23, 10/23/23, 10/25/23, 10/27/23, and 10/30/23, our team met predominantly via phone/messages and Discord. All members attended these meetings, which were scheduled flexibly based on everyoneâ€™s availability. We achieved a significant milestone in setting up the initial application structure, integrating account creation, and enabling Google login. We faced challenges in terms of integrating new tools and technologies, which resulted in some delays. However, the team showed remarkable commitment and adaptability. Going forward, we have decided to allocate more time for complex tasks, schedule training sessions for new tools, and introduce a rotating backup system for team member availability.

## 3. Product Backlog Refinement:
The key priorities for Sprint 2 will be to continue enhancing the user experience through robust account management and task handling features, keeping security and usability at the forefront.

## 4. Sprint Goal and Scope:
**Sprint Goal:** "To provide users with comprehensive control over their tasks and profiles, thereby improving their interaction with our application."

**Scope for This Sprint:**
- Enhance account security with a visible and accessible logout feature.
- Implement editable profile information.
- Develop a full suite for task management including creation, viewing, editing, and deletion.

## 5. Definition of Done:
For Sprint 2, the criteria remain consistent with the previous sprint, with an emphasis on learning from the previous challenges:
- All tasks under user stories must be fully completed.
- Acceptance Criteria must be met.
- Successful testing and code review.
- Correct integration into the main codebase.

## 6. Capacity Planning:
