## Sprint Review Meeting
| WHAT HAS BEEN DONE | WHAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE | FEEDBACKS? |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Story 1: As a developer, I want to set up an initial version of my application's structure. Tasks: Create initial "hello world" build; Upload "hello world" build to GitHub; Notify team about the build; Download node.js, react.js, and spring; All developers set up the build in their IDEs. | All tasks completed for this story. | While the initial setup went smoothly, there was a learning curve with some of the tools. Training sessions for the tools might be helpful in the future. |
| Story 2: As a user, I want to create an account and profile. Tasks: Open to account creation/login by default; Integrate Google login; Automate user profile creation; Require profile information on first login; Open to Task Dashboard after profile setup; Test account creation; Set up a database for account information. | All tasks completed for this story. | Integrating Google login took longer than expected. The team might need to allocate more time for integration tasks in future sprints. |
| Story 3: As a user, I want to log in with my gmail account. Tasks: Test Google login features; Add features not supported by Google login; Test login process; Set up spring session to track usage. | All tasks completed for this story. | Testing revealed that the Google login feature worked seamlessly. However, setting up the spring session required more time than initially thought. |

## Sprint Retrospective Meeting

| WHAT WENT WELL | WHAT DIDN’T GO SO WELL | INSIGHTS (up to 3)  AND ACTIONS (JUST ONE) |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| All tasks and stories were successfully completed. | Underestimated time constraints which led to some delays. | Insight: Need to allocate more time for tasks due to potential complications. <br> Action: Increase time estimates for future sprints. |
| Team remained committed and ensured that all deliverables were met despite challenges. | Complications arose from our lack of experience with the tools and technology. | Insight: The team requires more training or workshops. <br> Action: Schedule training sessions or workshops on the tools being used. |
| Positive collaboration and communication among team members which helped in addressing and overcoming challenges. | Team members had busy schedules outside of the project, from traveling to illness, which occasionally impacted availability and productivity. | Insight: Need a backup plan or contingency for unexpected personal commitments. <br> Action: Implement a rotating backup member system. |

**Each team member’s contribution on the project development.** Contribution works as a scalar multiplier applied to the group’s grade for an individual deliverable. This multiplier ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents that you provided minimal support to your team and 1 represents that you were a productive member of the team and did all assigned tasks.
